U-POWER — Modern Landing Page

A responsive landing page built as part of The Odin Project Foundations Curriculum, reimagined as a branded SaaS-style platform for a fictional human resources company.

U-POWER is designed as a bold, conversion-focused job placement platform that empowers professionals to connect directly with employers.

📌 Project Purpose

This project was originally completed for The Odin Project’s landing page assignment.

Rather than replicate the template directly, I redesigned the concept into a modern HR tech brand, focusing on:

Clean layout architecture

Strong visual hierarchy

Component reusability

Scalable CSS structure

Professional UI spacing and alignment

🧱 Built With

HTML5 (semantic structure)

CSS3

Flexbox

Modern layout techniques (aspect-ratio, object-fit)

Container-based layout system

✨ Features

Hero section with clear call-to-action

Testimonials section with portrait card layout

Job search input section

Call-to-action conversion banner

Reusable button system

Clean footer

Structured spacing and consistent alignment

🎯 Key Technical Decisions

1. Container Layout System

Implemented a centered max-width container pattern to ensure consistent horizontal alignment across all sections.

2. Predictable Box Model

Used:

_,
_::before,
\*::after {
box-sizing: border-box;
}

To prevent layout overflow and ensure consistent sizing behavior.

3. Image Consistency

Used:

aspect-ratio
object-fit: cover;
object-position;

To maintain uniform testimonial image sizing while preserving facial framing.

4. Component-Based Styling

Buttons, cards, and sections are structured for scalability and reuse.

🚀 Future Improvements

Full mobile responsiveness with media queries

Improved accessibility (ARIA, focus states, semantic landmarks)

Add subtle hover animations and transitions

Convert layout to CSS Grid for card sections

Expand into a multi-page mock product
